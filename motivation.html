            <p>
              Enviro-Hension emerged from the vision of Wangechi Karimi, a
              passionate environmentalist deeply engaged in various community
              initiatives throughout her life. From her involvement in church
              groups during high school to active participation in university
              clubs, including Rotaract clubs and various organizations,
              Wangechi recognized the commendable efforts of different volunteer
              organizations striving to make a positive impact in Kenya. These
              community-based organizations were intentional about creating
              change but often lacked the critical information needed to fully
              realize their social and environmental goals. Wangechi's journey
              through these diverse groups opened her eyes to the profound gap
              in environmental education and knowledge dissemination within
              various communities.

              Enviro-Hension took shape as an organization that seeks to empower
              communities with information and resources to undertake
              environmental sustainability projects effectively. This commitment
              to education and empowerment is at the core of our mission and the
              driving force behind our vision for a more sustainable future.
