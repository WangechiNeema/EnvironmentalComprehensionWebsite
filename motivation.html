            <p>
              Enviro-Hension emerged from the vision of Wangechi Karimi, a
              passionate environmentalist deeply engaged in various community
              initiatives throughout her life. From her involvement in church
              groups during high school to active participation in university
              clubs, including Rotaract clubs and various organizations,
              Wangechi recognized the commendable efforts of different volunteer
              organizations striving to make a positive impact in Kenya. These
              community-based organizations were intentional about creating
              change but often lacked the critical information needed to fully
              realize their social and environmental goals. Wangechi's journey
              through these diverse groups opened her eyes to the profound gap
              in environmental education and knowledge dissemination within
              various communities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Enviro-Hension took shape as an organization that seeks to empower
              communities with information and resources to undertake
              environmental sustainability projects effectively. This commitment
              to education and empowerment is at the core of our mission and the
              driving force behind our vision for a more sustainable future.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Key Climate Areas in Kenya</h2>

            <p>
              Kenya's economy heavily relies on tourism and rainfed agriculture,
              both vulnerable to climate change and extreme weather events.
              Rising temperatures and frequent droughts result in significant
              crop and livestock losses, leading to famine, displacement, and
              threats to human health. The country's predominantly low-lying
              coastline and surrounding islands face the risk of sea level rise,
              posing implications for the fisheries sector and storm surge
              protection.
            </p>
            <p>
              For years the residents of Syokimau, a flagship community for
              communities in Kenya greatly affected by pollution, have suffered
              pollution, respiratory diseases and even death caused by the
              massive emission by factories in Syokimau. The factories release
              dark smoke to these residential areas, to the point of soot
              settling in the communities homes and property.
            </p>
            <p>
              In early 2023, Kenya faced an unprecedented crisis with five
              consecutive below-average rainy seasons leading to the most severe
              drought in recent memory. Environmental and climate change issues
              in the Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASAL) region are escalating
              rapidly, affecting approximately 6.4 million people, including
              602,000 refugees in 2023. This marks a 35% increase from 2022 and
              stands as the highest recorded number of people affected and in
              need of humanitarian aid in Kenya over the last decade. Among
              pastoral areas, herders have suffered widespread losses, with a
              recorded 2.6 million livestock deaths attributed to the drought
              thereby creating environments for bandits and banditry
              attacks.Schools and other social institutions have closed
              indefinitely as parents and students flee bandits attacks in
              different affected parts of Kenya.
            </p>
            <p>
              In late 2023 over 80,000 families and homesteads were affected by
              the El-nino rains with areas in nothern Kenya seeing the submerge
              of markets, schools, hospitals and even police stations. The Kenya
              Meteorological Department had issued warnings of these heavy
              rains, despite the early on warning, the people and governments of
              Kenya were still caught off guard by the nature and state of the
              rains. These rains and the heat waves caused by climate change
              have created suitable conditions for the growth of vectors of
              disease carrying organisms that have seen a rise in spread of
              viral diseases such as the chikungunya and dengue virus, malaria.
              In addition the mass of waters have seen increased transmission of
              water communicable diseases such as cholera, bilharzia, typhoid.
              The environmental sustainability and climate change related issues
              in Kenya are an existing crisis, with very few of the affected
              communities having the knowledge and skills essential to help them
              navigate the challenges associated with these issues.
