          <h3>Discover</h3>
          <p>Enviro-Hension fosters discovery by identifying and recognizing gaps in environmental knowledge within communities. 
            Through research and partnerships, we seek out communities actively taking part in solving different environmental sustainability challenges. Our target communities range from, but are not limited to, grassroots youth organizations, church and community groups, organized persons, etc.  So long as these persons want to solve an environmental issue; from tree planting, to clean-ups, to petitions of pollution, etc. We are there!</p>

          <h3>Engage</h3>
          <p>Our approach is characterized by strategic collaboration with various communities. We assess their needs and environmental goals, develop tailored educational curricula guided by intensive research, and capacity build these communities to achieve their pre-defined goals. After these communities have been identified; we assess their needs and environmental goals. After assesment, development of a custom tailored curriculum guided by intensive research follows. 
                We work with these communities by capacity building them to achieve their pre-defined goals. At Enviro-Hension, we believe that an educated community makes an informed choice.</p>
